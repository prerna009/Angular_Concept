      "description": "Pip, a poor orphan being raised by a cruel sister, does not have much in the way of great expectations—until he is inexplicably elevated to wealth by an anonymous benefactor.

'Great Expectations has the most wonderful and most perfectly worked-out plot for a novel in the English language,' according to John Irving, and J. Hillis Miller declares, 'Great Expectations is the most unified and concentrated expression of Dickens’s abiding sense of the world, and Pip might be called the archetypal Dickens hero.",
